PEGZ_VFX_Shader_Brief.mdTo: Technical Artist / VFX Graph SpecialistContext: These effects are triggered by the PegMovementLogic.cs script.I. Shader Requirements (The "Material" Look)We need three master shaders to handle the character bodies. These must react to lighting to look "expensive" and detailed.Shader NameVisual StyleTechnical Properties (Shader Graph)S_BioGlassCracked, Dirty Glass w/ Liquid• Fresnel Rim Light: Bright green/pink edge glow.• Inner Liquid: A secondary mesh inside that uses vertex wobbling (Sine wave) to simulate fluid sloshing when the Peg moves.• Refraction: High distortion to warp the background.S_ToxicOozeFlowing, Radioactive Slime• Scrolling UVs: A noise texture that constantly moves slowly downward (melting look).• Smoothness: set to 0.9 (Very Wet/Glossy).• Subsurface Scattering: Allow light to bleed through the edges (Simulating jelly).S_GhostVelvetEthereal, Dusty Fabric• Alpha Erosion: The bottom of the peg should fade into transparency (no legs/feet).• Rim Noise: A flickering edge glow that mimics static or mist.II. Particle Effect Definitions (The "Events")These systems spawn based on specific gameplay triggers.1. The "Peg-Out" (Death Animation)Trigger: When a Peg is jumped over and removed.Bio Lab Version:Visual: Glass shattering burst (Mesh Emitter) + Splash of neon green liquid (Sprite Emitter).Decal: Leaves a temporary glowing puddle on the board.Haunted Version:Visual: The Peg implodes into a swarm of 5-6 small bats (Mesh Particles) and black smoke.Ooze Version:Visual: A massive "Pop" like a bubble bursting. Droplets fly outward and stick to the floor.2. The "Slick Slide" (Ooze World Logic)Trigger: When AnimateSlide coroutine starts in PegMovementLogic.cs.Trail Renderer: Attach a TrailRenderer to the Peg's base.Color: Bright Neon Green $\to$ Transparent.Width: Starts at 0.8 scale, tapers to 0.2.Texture: "Smear" texture.Contact Particles: Small green droplets kicking up behind the peg (like a car drifting in mud).3. The "Contamination Lock" (Bio Lab Logic)Trigger: When landing in a Red Zone.Initial Impact: A vertical "Warning" holographic cylinder flashes around the Peg.Looping State: Static electricity arcs (Lightning texture sheet animation) snap between the Peg and the Hole rim.UI Overlay: A floating, glitched "LOCK" icon appears above the head.4. The "Shadow Jump" (Haunted Ability)Trigger: Using the Vamp Ability.The Blur: During the jump arc, the Peg's mesh renderer is disabled and replaced by a VFX Graph that emits a "Clone" of the mesh every 0.05 seconds, creating a trailing echo effect.Color: The clones fade from Dark Purple $\to$ Black.III. Implementation Tips for Unity/GodotVFX Graph (Unity): Use VFX Graph for the "Ooze" and "Shatter" effects to handle high particle counts (thousands of droplets) without dropping FPS.Decal Projectors: Use Decal Projectors for the "Puddles" left behind. Do not spawn actual meshes, or you will clutter the scene geometry.Animation Events: Tie the Play() command of these particles strictly to the Animation Curves in the C# script (e.g., trigger the "Shatter" exactly when the jumping peg passes the apex of the arc).You now have the Code (Logic) and the Visuals (VFX/Shaders) defined.The last piece of the "Game Feel" puzzle is Sound. Visuals are only half the experience; the "squelch" needs to match the "splash."
