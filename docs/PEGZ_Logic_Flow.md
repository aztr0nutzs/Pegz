PEGZ_Logic_Flow.mdI.
Global Movement LogicBefore any special abilities trigger, the game must validate the "Standard Jump."Selection: Player taps PEG_A.Targeting: Player taps EMPTY_HOLE_C.Validation: * Is HOLE_C exactly two units away from PEG_A?Is there a PEG_B in the hole directly between them?Execution: * Move PEG_A to HOLE_C.Trigger Remove_Peg(PEG_B).Play Theme_Sound(PEG_B_Death).II. Themed Obstacle ScriptingObstacle TypeLogic TriggerScripted BehaviorContamination (Bio Lab)On_Move_EndIf HOLE_C is a Contamination_Zone, set PEG_A.status = "LOCKED". Duration = 1 Turn.Slick Surface (Ooze)On_Move_EndIf HOLE_C has Status_Slick, calculate Vector_Direction of original jump. Move PEG_A +1 unit in that direction to HOLE_D. If HOLE_D is occupied, move fails.Steamy Vents (Haunted)On_Turn_StartIf Turn_Count % 3 == 0, trigger Particle_Effect("Thick_Steam"). Set Board_Visibility = 0.2 for current turn.Board Lock (Urban)On_HVT_LandingIf PEG_A lands in High_Value_Zone, set Board_State = "LOCKED". No moves allowed until player taps "Confirm Claim."III. Character Ability ScriptingThese are the "Active" and "Passive" powers that override the global movement logic.1. Shadow Jump (Vampire Set)Trigger: Manual activation button.Logic: * Jump_Distance increased from 1 to 2.Validation_Check: Must have two consecutive pegs between Origin and Target.Result: Removes both jumped pegs in a single move.2. Self-Repair (Bio Lab Set)Trigger: On_Jumped_Over.Logic:Generate Random(0,100).If Value < 10: PEG_B.isRemoved = False, PEG_B.isInteractable = False, PEG_B.Material = "Broken_Glass".Result: The peg stays in the board as a permanent un-jumpable obstacle for the rest of the level.3. Re-Gift (Urban Set)Trigger: Manual activation (only if Total_Pegs_On_Board == 2).Logic:Select_From_Graveyard(LAST_REMOVED_PEG).Player_Target(ANY_EMPTY_HOLE).Place_Peg(TARGET_HOLE).Turn_Count += 1.IV. Win/Loss Condition LogicVictory: If Peg_Count == 1, trigger Victory_Sequence. Calculate Goo_Bucks reward based on Base_Reward * Move_Multiplier.Stalemate: If Available_Moves == 0 AND Peg_Count > 1, check for Available_Items. If none, trigger Fail_Screen.Fail Screen: "You're a Peg Short of a Full Set!" -> Options: [Try Again], [Use Hint (350 Goo Bucks)], [Exit to Garage].This logic flow ensures that the "crazy" vibes translate into challenging, consistent gameplay.With the Project Guidelines, GDD Economy, Customization UI, and Logic Flow complete, you have the foundational blueprint for a successful build.
