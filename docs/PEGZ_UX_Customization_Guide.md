I. The Hub: The PEGZ Garage
The main customization area is framed as a smoky, neon, industrial space—the "Garage"—where the player interacts with their collected items.

UI Element	Function	Visual Style
Header	Displays player stats, current Goo Bucks balance, and a counter for "PEGZ Sets Complete"	Neon glowing text over rusted metal. Goo Bucks icon is a toxic green, bubbling slime droplet.
Navigation Tabs	1. PEGZ SETS (Characters), 2. BOARD SKINS (Themes), 3. ABILITIES (Single-Use Items)	High-contrast, industrial buttons that pulse when new items are available.
Background	Dark, atmospheric garage with harsh spotlighting on the currently selected item.	

II. PEGZ SETS Menu (Character Collection)
This is the primary area for viewing and equipping the unique PEGZ character sets.

Display: A scrollable carousel showing all collected/locked PEGZ sets. When a set is selected, a 3D model of one of the character PEGZ (e.g., the Vampire Stripper) rotates in a central display case under a harsh, dramatic spotlight.

Set Listing:

Set Name: (e.g., The Midnight Mistresses, Test Tube Terrors)

Completion Tracker: Displays X/8 collected characters in the set.

Equip Button: Equips the full set of 8 PEGZ to the currently selected Board Skin.

Character Detail View (Pop-up):

Tapping a character within the set (e.g., the Angry Elf PEGZ) pulls up a full-screen view.

Displays the character's Flavor Name (e.g., "The Fang Banger," "Mr. Tentacles") and a short, absurd Lore Description of its origins.

Action: Allows the player to view the character's specific, unique ability (Shadow Jump, Re-Gift), even if that ability is not currently active on the equipped board.

Unlocking New Sets: Sets are unlocked either by clearing all levels in a theme or by spending Goo Bucks/Real Money in a separate "Acquisitions" tab (Monetization Hook).

III. BOARD SKINS Menu (Theme Customization)
This allows players to swap the cosmetic look of the board surface and surrounding environment.

Display: Shows a static, top-down view of the Board Skin (e.g., The Petri Dish, The Velvet Coffin).

Board Skin Content: Changing the skin modifies the following elements:

Board Texture: (e.g., Wet Ooze vs. Cracked Plywood)

Soundscape: (Ambient background music/drips/sizzles)

Peg-Out Sound: (e.g., Squishy Glop vs. Eerie Gasp)

Note: Changing the Board Skin is COSMETIC ONLY for previously completed levels. The gameplay mechanics (Slick Surfaces, Contamination Zones) are always tied to the currently selected Level/Difficulty (GDD Rule P-03).

Unlock Bonus: When the player completes a PEGZ Set (8/8 collected), they automatically unlock the Premium Board Skin associated with that set as a reward.

IV. ABILITIES Menu (Single-Use Items)
This menu manages the purchase and inventory of utility items.

Inventory: Displays current count of single-use items, purchased with Goo Bucks.

Example Items:

The Glitch: Grants one free, undo move.

The Scanner: Highlights the optimal next jump.

The Cleaner: Allows the player to permanently clear one Contamination Zone or Slime Trail during a puzzle for a limited time.

Purchase Area: Displays item packs and their Goo Bucks cost.

This design prioritizes showing off the unique PEGZ and connecting the collecting goals (Sets) with the reward (Board Skins).

Based on the GDD structure (G-01) and the project flow, the next necessary step is detailing the Monetization and Economy—specifically, the pricing and acquisition of Goo Bucks and the collected items (GDD Section IV). This is crucial for defining the value proposition of the collectibles.
