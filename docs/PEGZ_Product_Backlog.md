PEGZ: Product Backlog (Development Roadmap)
Sprint 1: The Skeleton (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
[ ] Core Engine: Implement the basic triangle board logic and the "Jump-to-Remove" mechanic.

[ ] Grid System: Create a flexible coordinate system for the board holes to allow for different board shapes later.

[ ] Tutorial Level: Build "The Void" (Level 0) with a simple UI.

[ ] Basic Animation: Script the "jump" arc for a generic placeholder peg.

Sprint 2: The "Ooze" Factor (Initial Theming)
[ ] Bio Lab Integration: Apply the "Petri Dish" board skin and the "Test Tube Terror" PEGZ models.

[ ] Obstacle Logic: Script the Contamination Zone (Locking logic) and the Self-Repair (10% RNG check).

[ ] Visual Feedback: Implement neon-green particle effects for contamination.

[ ] Sound Pass: Add the "Squelch & Pop" SFX for the Bio Lab theme.

Sprint 3: The Economy & Collection
[ ] The Garage UI: Build the main menu/customization screen (Tabs for PEGZ, Boards, Abilities).

[ ] Goo Bucks System: Implement the currency counter and "Level Clear" reward logic.

[ ] IAP Storefront: Set up the framework for purchasing Goo Buck bundles and the "Midnight Mistresses" set.

[ ] Save System: Ensure PEGZ collections and currency balances persist across sessions.

Sprint 4: Advanced Chaos (The Haunted & Urban Levels)
[ ] Haunted Scripting: Implement Steamy Vents (Visibility shaders) and the Shadow Jump ability.

[ ] Urban Chaos Scripting: Code the High-Value Zone (HVT) and the Re-Gift logic (Sacrifice move).

[ ] Level Progression: Build the level-unlock map from Level 1 through Level 12.

Sprint 5: Polish & Launch Preparation
[ ] VFX Overhaul: Add "screen shake" on heavy moves and flashy "Victory" animations.

[ ] Optimization: Ensure the shaders (Slime/Glass) run smoothly on mid-range mobile devices.

[ ] Bug Squashing: Specifically testing the Slick Surface sliding logic to ensure pieces don't slide off the board.
