From: Project Lead

Subject: Project Kickoff: PEGZ – A Hyper-Stylized Puzzle Reinvention

Status: Design Phase Complete / Production Entry

1. The Mission
We are building PEGZ, a mobile-first puzzle game that transforms the traditional "Peg Solitaire" mechanic into a high-contrast, edgy, and "crazy-looking" collectible experience. This is not a quiet board game; it is a visceral, loud, and mechanically deep reimagining.

2. Core Project Pillars
The Aesthetic: High-contrast, vibrant, and "gross-cool." Think neon-bio-labs, gothic-vampire-glamour, and urban-grit.

The Twist: Level-specific obstacles (Slick Surfaces, Contamination) and character-specific abilities (Shadow Jumps, Re-Gifting).

The Hook: A deep character collection system ("The Garage") where players collect sets of 8 unique PEGZ.

3. Immediate Technical Requirements (MVP)
The first milestone is a Functional Prototype containing:

Triangle Peg Logic: Standard jump-to-remove mechanics.

Theme 1 (Bio Lab): Implementation of "The Petri Dish" board and "Test Tube Terror" PEGZ.

Core Mechanic: The Contamination Zone (a target hole that locks a piece for one turn).

Audio/Visual: Initial "Squelch" feedback for successful jumps.

4. Reference Documentation Attached
The following documents are provided for full project context:

PEGZ_Project_Guidelines_for_Ai.md (The fundamental rules of the project)

PEGZ_GDD_Core.md (Full Game Design Document)

PEGZ_Logic_Flow.md (Technical scripting and ability rules)

PEGZ_Asset_List_v1.0.md (3D/2D/Audio requirements)

PEGZ_Product_Backlog.md (The prioritized task list)

5. Artist/Developer Action Items
Developers: Please review PEGZ_Logic_Flow.md and prepare a framework for the "Slick Surface" momentum physics.

Artists: Please begin conceptualizing the "Test Tube Terror" base model—focus on the translucent glass and the floating eyeball.

🏁 Finalizing the Blueprint
We have successfully built a complete Game Design Universe. We have:

Guidelines to keep the project on track.

Levels that tell a story.

Characters with personality.

Economics that make sense.

Marketing to find an audience.
