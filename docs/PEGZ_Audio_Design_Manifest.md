Global UI & System SoundsThese sounds provide consistency across all menus and board transitions.EventSound DescriptionLayering TipMenu SelectA heavy, metallic "clunk" with a digital glitch tail.Layer a hammer strike with a static burst.Goo Buck EarnedA rapid, liquid "glup-glup-glup" followed by a cash register "ding."Use a pitch-shifted bubble pop.Level UnlockDeep, cinematic bass drop with a mechanical "unlocking" sound.Think a vault door opening in a warehouse.II. Theme-Specific Gameplay AudioEach theme has a unique "Peg-Out" (Capture) sound and "Move" (Jump) sound to reinforce the atmosphere.🧪 1. Bio Lab (The Test Tube Terrors)The Jump: A pressurized "hiss" of steam as the peg takes off.The Landing: A hard glass "clink" on a metal surface.The Peg-Out (Capture): [Shatter + Squelch] The sound of a test tube breaking followed by a wet, organic splash.🦇 2. Haunted Level (The Midnight Mistresses)The Jump: A ghostly, low-pitched "whoosh" or the sound of many wings flapping.The Landing: A soft, heavy thud—like a body hitting a velvet rug.The Peg-Out (Capture): [Gasp + Bat Swarm] A sharp intake of breath (female voice) followed by the high-pitched chirping of bats fading out.🤮 3. Ooze World (The Goopy Golems)The Jump: A suction sound—like pulling a boot out of thick mud.The Slide: A continuous, wet "shhhhhhp" sound that lasts as long as the slide animation.The Peg-Out (Capture): [The Big Pop] A loud, hollow "PLOP" (like a massive bubble bursting) followed by a dripping sound.🎁 4. Urban Chaos (The Holiday Miscreants)The Jump: A quick "Hey!" or "Get 'em!" shout (low fidelity, like a police radio).The HVT Landing: A loud, triumphant "Cha-Ching!" or the sound of a police siren "whoop-whoop."The Peg-Out (Capture): [Breaking Glass + Running] The sound of a storefront window smashing followed by quick footsteps on pavement.III. Dynamic Audio Scripting LogicTo keep the audio from becoming repetitive, the AudioManager.cs should follow these rules:Pitch Randomization: Every time a Peg-Out occurs, the engine should slightly randomize the pitch between 0.9x and 1.1x. This makes every capture feel unique.The "Win" Harmonic: As the player gets closer to the final peg, the background music (BGM) should gradually increase in tempo or add a high-frequency synth layer to build tension.Haptic Feedback (Mobile): * Standard Jump: Light "Tap" haptic.Peg-Out: Heavy "Boom" haptic.Slick Slide: Continuous low-frequency rumble.IV.
