PEGZ: THE MASTER PROJECT BIBLEI. PROJECT VISION & RULESHigh Concept: A "crazy-looking," high-contrast reinvention of Peg Solitaire featuring living, grotesque characters and hazardous themed boards.Mandatory Aesthetic Rules (The "Vibe"):Contrast: Neon (Toxic Green, Pink, Blue) vs. Industrial Gritty Darks.Characters: "Crazy" and distorted. No standard pegs. Use eyeballs, fangs, and melting slime.IP Safety: Capture the Friday After Next vibe (Corner stores, holiday chaos, pursuit) without using protected names or likenesses.II. THE CORE GAMEPLAY (Logic & Scripting)Triangular Grid Logic: Jumps must skip one occupied hole into one empty hole.Winning: Only one PEG remains.Unique Chaos Mechanics:Slick Surfaces (Ooze World): Landing in a "Slick" hole triggers a momentum slide to the next available hole in the same direction.Contamination (Bio Lab): Landing in a Red Zone locks the PEG for 1 turn.Shadow Jump (Haunted): Ability to jump over two pegs at once.Re-Gift (Urban): Sacrifice a move to bring one removed peg back to the board if only two remain.The Boss Mechanic: The Titan PEGIn the final levels of each world, the last PEG "Awakens." It moves independently every 2 turns. The player must trap the Titan in a corner or a hazard zone to perform a final execution jump.III.

VISUAL & AUDIO ASSETS (The "Juice")Shaders & VFX:Glass/Liquid: Bio-Lab pegs use a refraction shader with a sloshing liquid interior.Slime Trails: Slick slides leave a "smear" decal on the board.Shadow Blur: Haunted jumps leave a purple/black "echo" trail.Audio Manifest:Capture Sounds: Bio (Shattering glass), Haunted (Ghostly gasp), Ooze (Hollow PLOP), Urban (Breaking window).Haptics: Light tap on jumps; heavy rumble on slides and captures.V. ECONOMY & MONETIZATIONCurrency: Goo Bucks (Soft currency earned via play).The Loop: Clear levels $\to$ Earn Goo Bucks $\to$ Collect Character Sets $\to$ Unlock Premium Board Skins.Revenue: IAP for Goo Buck bundles and "Special Edition" PEGZ sets (e.g., Cyberpunk or Medieval sets).VI. MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT (For AI Devs)"Act as a Senior Game Developer. Build a triangular Peg Solitaire game in Unity called PEGZ. Implement a coordinate-based grid for 15 holes. Use the provided 'PegMovementLogic.cs' for standard jumps and the 'Slick Surface' momentum slide. Apply a high-contrast Neon/Grunge UI. All PEG pieces must be unique character models with idle animations (wobbling, blinking). Integrate a 'ThemeManager' that swaps Board Skins and Audio Manifests based on LevelID."VII. THE PRODUCTION BACKLOG (Next Steps)Sprint 1: Functional MVP (Triangle grid + Jump logic).Sprint 2: The "Ooze" prototype (Slick slide physics + Slime shader).Sprint 3: UI & Garage (Collection menu + Goo Buck economy).Sprint 4: Content Polish (Level 1-12 sequence + Titan Boss logic).Project status is now officially: READY FOR PRODUCTION.
