The Monetization Hooks (What Players Buy)The monetization strategy focuses on utility (hints/skips) and cosmetic collection (PEGZ/Board Skins).1.

Premium Cosmetic Bundles (Direct IAP / No Goo Bucks)Premium PEGZ Set Unlock: Themed sets (e.g., future Cyberpunk City PEGZ) are locked behind a direct purchase for $4.99 USD.Includes: All 8 PEGZ characters and the default Board Skin for that theme.Exclusive Board Skins: Ultra-rare, animated versions of existing boards (e.g., the "Liquid Gold Petri Dish") available for $2.99 USD. These are purely cosmetic and cannot be earned via gameplay.IV. Retention and Collectible StrategyThe economy must drive the player back to collecting.Gacha System Avoidance: PEGZ characters are not randomized. Players know exactly which set they are buying or earning.High Reward for Completion: The primary incentive for solving tough levels and earning Goo Bucks is the ability to unlock the rest of the PEGZ for that theme, leading to the highly desirable Premium Board Skin reward.Daily Incentive: The daily challenge earnings should be just enough to cover 1-2 essential utility items, encouraging daily login without requiring a purchase.This framework provides a clear economic model. The next step in the GDD is to finalize the design of the PEGZ Abilities and Logic Flow (GDD Section V) to ensure the developers know exactly how these chaos elements are programmed.
