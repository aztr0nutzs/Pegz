Build the Cracker Barrel Peg Game as a premium Android app with cyberpunk holographic visuals, smooth touch interactions, and addictive modes for Play Store monetization. Leverage AI assistants like Gemini in Android Studio, Cursor, and Claude for iterative code generation. Follow this blueprint using your preferred neon/dark aesthetic from past projects .Core Game MechanicsThe triangular board has 15 holes in 5 rows (1-2-3-4-4), starting with 14 pegs and one empty hole ��. Pegs jump over adjacent pegs into empty holes, removing the jumped peg; goal is one peg left ("Genius" if center). Use a 2D grid array (int[][] board = new int��) where 0=empty, 1=peg; validate moves with direction vectors (±1 row, ±1 col or diagonals matching triangle geometry) �. Add undo stack via move history list for touch-friendly resets.Visual DesignRender as floating holographic triangle in dark void: neon-glow pegs (cyan/red shaders), board frame with pulsing edges and rain reflections, particle sparks on jumps . Background: animated cyberpunk cityscape or lab with bloom effects. Pegs: metallic orbs with hover glow (scale up 1.2x on touch), empty holes as dark voids with scanline flicker. Use Canvas or Jetpack Compose with shaders for 60fps on mid-range Android �.New Features & ModesClassic: Standard Cracker Barrel with 4 difficulties (top/middle/bottom/corners empty).Timed: 60s rounds, combos multiply score.Endless: Procedural larger boards (up to 33 holes), meta-progression unlocks skins.Daily Challenge: Unique starting hole + hint system.VS AI: Minimax solver (depth 6) with easy/medium/hard �.Multiplayer: Local hotseat or simple online via Firebase (future).
Scores persist via Room DB; achievements for <4 pegs left.Step-by-Step Development PlanSetup (Day 1): Install Android Studio Iguana+; create new Compose project "PegNeonGame" (min SDK 26). Enable Gemini (Tools > Gemini); paste initial super prompt below into new chat �.Core Logic (Days 2-3): Prompt Gemini/Cursor for BoardState.kt (grid, move validation, win check), GameViewModel.kt (MVVM state). Test via emulator: draw triangle, tap-to-select/jump pegs.UI Polish (Days 4-5): Generate CyberpunkTheme.kt, PegBoard composable with Canvas drawing, animations (AnimatedVisibility, InfiniteTransition for glow). Add sound (AssetManager beeps).Modes & AI (Days 6-7): Prompt for ModeSelector screen, MinimaxAI.kt. Integrate SharedPreferences for high scores.Monetization (Day 8): Add Play Billing (remove ads/one-time unlock), AdMob interstitials post-game. One-time purchase $1.99 for ad-free + endless mode .Build & Test (Days 9-10): Profile FPS (60+ target), add haptics (VibratorManager). Generate signed APK via Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK.Polish/Launch: Iterate prompts for particles, leaderboards (Play Games Services). Upload to Play Console with cyberpunk icons/screenshots.AI Workflow TipsStart each session with: "Continue PegNeonGame from [last file]. Fix [bug] per Android best practices." Use Gemini for Studio integration (autocomplete/refactor), Cursor for full-file gen, Claude for architecture review. Version via Git: commit after each milestone. Fork open-source Peg Solitaire repos for validation �
